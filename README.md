# hello!
hi, this is a repository that contains my C++ apps, recipes and helpful examples that I wrote while working on various projects since 2017 year.

# /apps
there are mainly Qt 5.7 apps that use slots and signals and also modern ones that use QML language to draw distinct newest, well-looking widgets.

## /opengl_paint_line_and_arc
this is an app that uses Open GL and glut library to draw lines and arcs. this is project with an interesting history. I wrote this app to get a job. it was a test for a job interview. I like this app, because it wasn't easy to perform this task and consequently I decided to maintain and rework this app a bit.
