before add to review:
1) check if the application is compiled without errors
2) verify whether there is a header guard inside *.h files
3) check if comments are correct and up-to-date
4) function prototypes probably shoud have ' extern "C" ' block if:
- you write C++ code that you will use in C programs
- you will compile C code with C++ compiler in the future
5) a commit message is correct and good enough
6) tests of new functionality was performed
7) there are no needless blank spaces at the end of lines
8) the new code uses tabs or spaces as well as the previous code does
9) make the destructor of the class be virtual
10) remove all helpless comments that shoudn't be in the final version
11) new *.cpp files must be added to the *.MakeFile
12) run unit tests
13) one-line if statement must be as follows:
 
bool result = ((a == 1) ? true : false)

to avoid the misinterpretation.
